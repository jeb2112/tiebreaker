## TieBreaker

The TieBreaker android app is a calculator that may be used during the round robin stage of a hockey tournament.
### Overview
- TieBreaker app analyzes a set of games in the preliminary round-robin of a hockey tournament.
- Most typically, there could be four teams in the round-robin, three games played by each team, and two teams qualifying for further play.
- In the event of a tie for 2nd and 3rd place in the round robin standings, a tie-breaker formula is used to determine the qualifier.
- Frequently, the formula is a fraction or ratio deriving from goals tallied, both for and against.
- This assessment is easily made after the final game of the round robin has been played when all the scoring is known.
- However, for fans of the 3rd and final game of one or both of the teams in question, it may be of interest to know the several goal-scoring scenarios that lead to qualification, _before_ or _during_ that final 3rd game.
- TieBreaker app displays those goal-scoring scenarios.
