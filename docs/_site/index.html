<ul>
  <li>TieBreaker app analyzes a set of games in the preliminary round-robin of a hockey tournament.</li>
  <li>Most typically, there could be four teams in the round-robin, three games played by each team, and two teams qualifying for further play.</li>
  <li>In the event of a tie for 2nd and 3rd place in the round robin standings, a tie-breaker formula is used to determine the qualifier.</li>
  <li>Frequently, the formula is a fraction or ratio deriving from goals tallied, both for and against.</li>
  <li>This assessment is easily made after the final game of the round robin has been played when all the scoring is known.</li>
  <li>However, for fans of the 3rd and final game of one or both of the teams in question, it may be of interest to know the several goal-scoring scenarios that lead to qualification, <em>before</em> or <em>during</em> that final 3rd game.</li>
  <li>TieBreaker app displays those goal-scoring scenarios.</li>
